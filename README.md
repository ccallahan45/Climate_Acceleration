# Is global warming accelerating? Not relative to greenhouse gas emissions.

Code and data for blog post analysis on the relationship between climate trends and CO2 emissions. 

`Acceleration_Analysis_Public.R` does the analysis. `Acceleration_Plots.ipynb` makes the figures. You'll need R and Jupyter/Python if you want to run the code.
